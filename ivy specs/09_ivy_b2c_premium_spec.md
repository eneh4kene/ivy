# 1. Overview

## What Is Ivy Premium?

Ivy Premium is a high-touch accountability service for individuals who are serious about building consistent habits — and willing to pay for something that actually works.

Unlike apps you download and ignore, Ivy is proactive. She calls you. She follows up. She adapts to your calendar. She notices when you're slipping. And every time you follow through, your Impact Wallet donates to charity.

## Who Is This For?

| Persona | Description | Why They Pay |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **The Busy Founder** | Running a company, health is slipping, knows what to do but doesn't do it | Needs external structure; can't rely on willpower |
| **The Lapsed Athlete** | Used to be fit, life got in the way, wants to get back | Needs someone to notice and hold the line |
| **The Overwhelmed Professional** | High performer at work, personal life is chaotic | Needs accountability that integrates with their calendar |
| **The Health Wake-Up** | Doctor said something; partner said something; they know it's time | Needs support without judgment |

## What Makes This Premium (Not Just "More Expensive")

| Standard App | Ivy Premium |
|--------------|-------------|
| You open the app | Ivy calls you |
| Notifications you ignore | Voice conversations you can't swipe away |
| Generic reminders | Calendar-aware, context-aware check-ins |
| You track yourself | Ivy tracks, reflects, and reminds you of progress |
| Points and badges | Real charity donations |
| Alone | Community of other premium users (Ivy Circle) |
| Algorithm | Human review (Concierge tier) |

# 3. User Experience — The Premium Journey

## 3.1 The Premium Promise

When someone pays £199/month for Ivy Elite, they're not buying an app. They're buying:

1. **Someone who shows up** — Ivy calls at the times you set, every time
2. **Someone who notices** — Ivy knows your schedule, your patterns, your struggles
3. **Someone who adapts** — Travel mode, sick days, busy weeks — Ivy adjusts
4. **Someone who cares** — Not judgment, but genuine accountability
5. **Proof of progress** — Not just streaks, but transformation data
6. **Meaning** — Every follow-through creates real-world impact

## 3.2 Meet Priya: An Elite User Journey

### Who Is Priya?

- 38 years old, founder of a 15-person creative agency
- Works 60+ hours/week, always "on"
- Knows she needs to exercise, sleep more, protect focus time
- Tried apps (abandoned), trainers (too expensive ongoing), accountability buddies (felt like a chore)
- Found Ivy through a podcast, signed up for Elite (£199/month)

### What Priya's Week Looks Like

**Sunday Evening — Weekly Planning Call**

*Phone rings at 6:00pm — Priya's chosen time.*

**Ivy:** "Hey Priya. End of the weekend. Let's look at the week ahead. I'm seeing your calendar — Monday's packed, Tuesday has a 2-hour gap at lunch, Wednesday is lighter. How do you want to structure your three workouts?"

**Priya:** "Monday's definitely out. Tuesday lunch could work. Wednesday morning. And maybe Friday?"

**Ivy:** "Tuesday lunch, Wednesday morning, Friday. What time Wednesday?"

**Priya:** "7am, before the day starts."

**Ivy:** "7am Wednesday. And Friday — morning or end of day?"

**Priya:** "Let's say lunch again. That seems to work."

**Ivy:** "Tuesday lunch, Wednesday 7am, Friday lunch. I'm blocking these on your calendar now. If anything shifts, text me and we'll adjust. Monday I'll send a WhatsApp nudge just to check in. Talk Tuesday morning."

**Priya:** "Thanks Ivy."

**Ivy:** "Rest up. Big week ahead."

*Call length: 2 minutes, 15 seconds.*

---

**Monday, 8:00am — WhatsApp Nudge**

```
Ivy: Morning Priya. Rest day today — no workout planned. Just checking: 
energy level right now, 1-10?

Priya: 6

Ivy: Got it. Tomorrow's workout is blocked for 12:30. What's the plan — 
Peloton, gym, run?

Priya: Peloton. 30-minute ride.

Ivy: 30-min Peloton at 12:30 Tuesday. I'll call tomorrow morning to 
confirm. Have a good Monday.
```

---

**Tuesday, 8:15am — Morning Call**

**Ivy:** "Morning Priya. Peloton at 12:30 — still the plan?"

**Priya:** "Yeah, but I'm nervous about the afternoon. I have a client call at 2 and I might not have time to shower."

**Ivy:** "Could you do 20 minutes instead of 30? That gives you buffer."

**Priya:** "Yeah, that's smart. 20 minutes."

**Ivy:** "20-minute Peloton at 12:30. I'll text at 12:15 as a reminder. Talk tonight."

---

**Tuesday, 12:17pm — WhatsApp**

```
Ivy: 12:30 Peloton — 13 minutes. Ready?

Priya: About to get on

Ivy: Go. Text 'done' when you're off.
```

**Tuesday, 12:52pm**

```
Priya: done

Ivy: 20 minutes logged. £1.50 to the food bank. That's 1 of 3 this week. 
How do you feel?

Priya: Good actually. Energized.

Ivy: That's the point. Talk tomorrow morning for the 7am.
```

---

**Tuesday, 8:30pm — WhatsApp Check-in**

```
Ivy: End of Tuesday. You got the workout in. Energy now vs. this morning?

Priya: Higher actually. Like a 7.

Ivy: Movement does that. Sleep goal tonight?

Priya: In bed by 10:30.

Ivy: I'll nudge at 10:15. Rest well.
```

**Tuesday, 10:18pm**

```
Ivy: 10:30 bedtime — 12 minutes. Winding down?

Priya: Yes, phone going away now

Ivy: Good. 7am workout tomorrow. I'll call at 6:50. Sleep well.
```

---

**Wednesday, 6:52am — Morning Call**

**Ivy:** "Morning Priya. 7am workout — you've got 8 minutes. What's the plan?"

**Priya:** "Ugh. I'm so tired. Bad sleep."

**Ivy:** "What happened?"

**Priya:** "Woke up at 3am thinking about a client thing. Couldn't fall back asleep."

**Ivy:** "That's rough. Here's the question: full workout, minimum, or rest day? Your call."

**Priya:** "What's my minimum again?"

**Ivy:** "You said 15 minutes of yoga."

**Priya:** "I can do that."

**Ivy:** "15 minutes of yoga. That's a win on a hard day. Text me done when you're finished. And Priya — showing up tired is worth more than showing up motivated. Talk tonight."

---

**Wednesday, 7:25am**

```
Priya: done. actually did 20 mins

Ivy: See? The hard part is starting. £1.50 to the food bank. That's 2 of 3 
this week. Rest today — you earned it. Friday we close it out.
```

---

**Wednesday, 8:00pm — Weekly Pulse**

```
Ivy: Mid-week check. Energy today, 1-10?

Priya: 5. Still recovering from bad sleep.

Ivy: Makes sense. Mood?

Priya: 6.

Ivy: Noted. Bed early tonight?

Priya: Yes. No phone after 9.

Ivy: Good call. Talk Friday morning.
```

---

**Friday, 8:00am — Morning Call**

**Ivy:** "Morning Priya. Last workout of the week. Lunch Peloton still the plan?"

**Priya:** "Actually, I want to run. It's nice outside."

**Ivy:** "Lunch run. Love it. How long?"

**Priya:** "30 minutes around the park."

**Ivy:** "30-minute run at lunch. I'll text at 12:15. This closes out the week — three for three. Let's do it."

---

**Friday, 1:15pm**

```
Priya: done. 35 minutes actually

Ivy: 3 for 3. Weekly goal hit. £4.50 to the food bank this week — £67 total 
since you started. Quick pulse before the weekend: energy 1-10?

Priya: 7!

Ivy: That's your highest in three weeks. Mood?

Priya: 7 too.

Ivy: You're not just showing up more. You're feeling better. That's the 
whole point. Rest this weekend. I'll call Sunday to plan next week.
```

---

**Sunday, 6:00pm — Weekly Planning + Monthly Check-in**

**Ivy:** "Hey Priya. Before we plan the week — it's been a month. Quick check-in. First: any physical changes you've noticed?"

**Priya:** "My clothes fit better. And I have more energy in the afternoons."

**Ivy:** "Both noted. Second: anything you can do now that you couldn't — or wouldn't — a month ago?"

**Priya:** "I took the stairs at a client's office. Fifth floor. Didn't even think about it."

**Ivy:** "That's a life marker. Third: health confidence overall, 1 to 10?"

**Priya:** "7. When I started I was like a 4."

**Ivy:** "That's a 75% increase in how you feel about your health. In one month. That's what consistency does. Okay — let's plan the week. What's the calendar look like?"

# 4. White-Glove Onboarding

## 4.1 What Makes It "White-Glove"

| Standard App Onboarding | Ivy Premium Onboarding |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Fill out a form | 15-45 min guided conversation |
| Pick some goals | Deep dive on obstacles, patterns, triggers |
| Generic reminders | Personalized schedule based on real calendar |
| One-size-fits-all | Custom "playbook" with if/then rules |
| Start immediately | "Calibration week" to learn your patterns |

## 4.2 Onboarding by Tier

| Tier | Duration | Format | Output |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Pro | 15 min | Self-serve + Ivy call | Basic schedule, goals, charity |
| Elite | 30 min | Guided Ivy call | Full playbook, calendar sync, escalation rules |
| Concierge | 45 min | Human call + Ivy setup | Comprehensive plan, human review, custom scripts |

## 4.3 Elite/Concierge Onboarding Flow

### Part 1: Foundation (10 min)

**Ivy:** "Welcome to Ivy. Let's set this up right. First, the basics: what's your primary track — Fitness, Focus, Sleep, or Balance?"

**User:** "Fitness."

**Ivy:** "Fitness it is. What's your goal? Not the dream — the weekly target. How many workouts per week feels ambitious but doable?"

**User:** "Three."

**Ivy:** "Three workouts per week. And what counts as a workout for you? Gym, run, class, home workout?"

**User:** "Any of those. I just want to move."

**Ivy:** "Perfect. Three sessions of intentional movement per week. That's the goal."

### Part 2: Obstacles (10 min)

**Ivy:** "Now the important part: what usually stops you? Be specific."

**User:** "I plan to work out after work, but by 6pm I've convinced myself I'm too tired."

**Ivy:** "The evening fade. Very common. What about mornings?"

**User:** "I'm not a morning person."

**Ivy:** "Fair. What about lunch?"

**User:** "Actually... that might work. I have flexibility there."

**Ivy:** "Let's try lunch as your primary window. If that fails, evenings as backup. What time is lunch flexible?"

**User:** "12 to 2, usually."

**Ivy:** "12 to 2 is the window. I'll check your calendar and schedule around meetings. What's your backup window if lunch is blocked?"

**User:** "6pm, I guess. But I'll probably talk myself out of it."

**Ivy:** "That's where I come in. If 6pm comes and you're wavering, text me. We'll negotiate a minimum. Speaking of which — what's your minimum viable workout? The thing you can do even when you don't want to do anything?"

**User:** "15-minute walk."

**Ivy:** "15-minute walk. That's your floor. On the worst days, that counts."

### Part 3: Motivation (5 min)

**Ivy:** "One more thing. When motivation fades, why does this actually matter? Who are you doing this for — besides yourself?"

**User:** "My kids. I want to be able to keep up with them."

**Ivy:** "Your kids. Got it. On hard days, I'll remind you of that — not to guilt you, but to reconnect you to why this matters."

### Part 4: Logistics (5 min)

**Ivy:** "Let's lock in the schedule. I'll call you before your workout windows to plan, and after to check in. What time works for morning calls?"

**User:** "8am is fine."

**Ivy:** "8am morning calls. And evening check-ins?"

**User:** "7pm."

**Ivy:** "8am and 7pm. I'm connecting to your calendar now — I'll see your meetings and plan around them. For charity, here are the options: [lists]. Which one matters to you?"

**User:** "Mental health. Mind."

**Ivy:** "Mind it is. Every workout you complete, £1.50 goes to Mind. That's about £18-20 per month if you hit your goals."

### Part 5: Confirmation

**Ivy:** "Let me read this back:

- Track: Fitness
- Goal: 3 workouts per week
- Primary window: Lunch (12-2pm)
- Backup window: Evening (6pm)
- Minimum: 15-minute walk
- Who you're doing this for: Your kids
- Charity: Mind
- Call times: 8am (morning), 7pm (evening)

First call is tomorrow at 8am. This week is calibration — I'm learning your patterns. After that, we're locked in. Any questions?"

**User:** "No, I think that's everything."

**Ivy:** "Good. Talk tomorrow. Let's see what you're capable of."

# 5. The Daily/Weekly Rhythm

## 5.1 Call Types

| Call Type | When | Duration | Purpose |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| Morning Planning | Before workout window | 45-90 sec | Lock in today's plan |
| Evening Review | After workout window | 30-60 sec | Log completion, reflect |
| Rescue | User-initiated | 1-3 min | Negotiate minimum when about to skip |
| Weekly Planning | Sunday evening | 2-4 min | Review week, plan ahead |
| Monthly Check-in | First of month | 3-5 min | Life markers, transformation data |

## 5.2 WhatsApp Touchpoints

| Nudge Type | Timing | Example |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Pre-workout reminder | 15 min before | "12:30 workout — 15 minutes. Ready?" |
| Post-workout logging | If no call | "Did the workout happen? Reply 'done' or 'skip'" |
| Evening pulse | Before bed | "Energy today, 1-10?" |
| Bedtime nudge | 15 min before goal | "10:30 bedtime — winding down?" |
| Streak update | After completion | "That's 8 days in a row. £12 to Mind." |
| Weekly summary | Sunday morning | "This week: 3/3 ✓, £4.50 donated, energy up 20%" |

## 5.3 The Rescue Flow (Critical)

This is where Ivy earns the premium price — the moment the user is about to skip.

**User texts at 5:45pm:**

```
User: I really don't want to go to the gym

Ivy: I hear you. Let's talk about it.

What's making it hard right now?

User: Just exhausted. Long day. I want to go home.

Ivy: That's real. Here's the question: full workout, minimum, or 
true rest day?

Your minimum is a 15-minute walk. That keeps the streak alive.

User: I could probably do that

Ivy: 15-minute walk. When?

User: On my way home. There's a park.

Ivy: Walk through the park on the way home. Text me 'done' when 
you're through.

This isn't about perfect. It's about not letting one hard day 
become a spiral.

User: Ok

[30 minutes later]

User: done. walked 20 mins actually

Ivy: See? The hardest part is deciding to start.

£1.50 to Mind. Streak alive. 

Go rest. You earned it.
```

# 6. Transformation Tracking

## 6.1 The Transformation Layer

Ivy doesn't just track consistency. She tracks what's actually changing.

| Metric | Frequency | Capture Method |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Energy (1-10) | Weekly | End-of-week call/WhatsApp |
| Mood (1-10) | Weekly | End-of-week call/WhatsApp |
| Health confidence (1-10) | Monthly | Monthly check-in call |
| Life markers (qualitative) | Monthly | Open-ended question |
| Progress photos (optional) | Monthly | User-controlled, prompted |

## 6.2 How Ivy Uses Transformation Data

**Reflecting progress in conversation:**

> "Your energy this week was 7. When you started six weeks ago, it was 4. That's not the workouts — that's you becoming someone different."

**During rescue moments:**

> "I know you're tired. But remember last month? You told me you finally kept up with your kids at the park. That came from days like today — when you didn't feel like it but did something anyway."

**Creating "remember when" moments:**

> "Three months ago you told me you couldn't walk up stairs without getting winded. Last week you ran 5K. Do you see what happened?"

## 6.3 Monthly Life Markers Check

**Ivy:** "Quick monthly check. Three questions.

First: any physical changes you've noticed? Clothes, mirror, anything?"

**User:** "Pants are looser. Face looks less puffy."

**Ivy:** "Noted. Second: anything you can do now that you couldn't — or wouldn't — do a month ago?"

**User:** "I played basketball with my son for an hour. That's never happened before."

**Ivy:** "That's a life marker. That's why you're doing this. Third: health confidence overall, 1 to 10?"

**User:** "7. Started at 3."

**Ivy:** "That's more than double. In three months. Nice work."

# 7. Ivy Circle — Community Layer

## 7.1 What Is Ivy Circle?

Ivy Circle is a community layer for Elite and Concierge users — small cohorts of premium users who support each other.

## 7.2 How It Works

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Cohort size | 8-12 people |
| Matching criteria | Same track (Fitness/Focus/etc.) + similar goals |
| Duration | Ongoing (not seasons) |
| Cadence | Monthly group call + optional ongoing connection |

## 7.3 The Monthly Circle Call (45 min)

**Facilitated by human coach (for premium):**

```
AGENDA
────────

1. Check-in round (15 min)
   Each person: "What's working? What's hard?"
   
2. Wins celebration (5 min)
   "Who hit a milestone? Who had a breakthrough?"
   
3. Hot seat (15 min)
   One person shares a specific challenge
   Group offers input and accountability
   
4. Accountability pairs (5 min)
   Matched with one person to text during the month
   
5. One commitment (5 min)
   Each person states ONE focus for the next month
```

## 7.4 Accountability Pairs

After each Circle call, users are matched with one other person:

**The agreement:**
- Text each other at least once per week
- Check in on hard days
- Celebrate wins
- No judgment

**How Ivy supports it:**

> "Your accountability pair this month is James. He's also working on fitness consistency. I've introduced you via text. Check in with each other when it's hard."

## 7.5 Circle-Only Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Shared challenges | "Circle 7 goal: 500 collective workouts this quarter" |
| Private community | Slack/Discord channel for async support |
| Peer accountability | Others notice when you're absent |
| Social proof | "Everyone else is struggling too — and still showing up" |

# 8. Premium Features Deep Dive

## 8.1 Calendar Integration (Elite+)

**How it works:**
- Two-way Google Calendar or Outlook sync
- Ivy sees meetings, blocks, and commitments
- Ivy schedules workouts around conflicts
- Ivy auto-reschedules when things shift

**In conversation:**

> "Looking at your calendar, tomorrow is packed 9-4, but you have a gap at lunch. Want me to block 12:30 for your workout?"

**Auto-rescheduling:**

> "Your 6pm workout got bumped — I see a client meeting moved into that slot. I've moved your workout to 7pm. That still work?"

## 8.2 Missed-Call Recovery (Elite+)

**If user doesn't answer:**

1. Immediate: Leave voicemail + send WhatsApp
2. 30 minutes later: Second call attempt
3. 1 hour later: WhatsApp with options
4. End of day: Final check-in

**WhatsApp after missed call:**

```
Ivy: Missed you this morning. No worries.

Quick check: what's the workout plan today?

Reply with your plan, or 'rest' if you're taking the day off.
```

## 8.3 Escalation Rules (Concierge)

Users can set custom escalation rules:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Miss 2 days in a row | Extra call in the evening |
| Miss 3 days in a row | Human coach review |
| Skip morning call twice | Switch to WhatsApp check-in |
| Bedtime goal missed 3x | Add earlier "wind down" nudge |
| Vacation mode activated | Pause calls, send daily WhatsApp only |

**User sets rules during onboarding:**

> "If I miss twice in a row, call me again at 9pm. If I miss three times, I want a human to review what's going on."

## 8.4 Human Review (Concierge Only)

**Weekly human review includes:**

- Coach reviews transcripts and patterns
- Identifies blind spots or drift
- Adjusts Ivy's approach (different nudges, timing, language)
- Sends personalized note or voice message

**Example human note:**

> "Hey Marcus, I noticed you've been hitting snooze on the morning calls but crushing it when you switch to lunch workouts. I've adjusted Ivy to stop calling before 10am and focus on the midday window instead. Also, your energy scores have been dipping on Wednesdays — is there something about Tuesdays that's draining you? Let's talk about it in your quarterly call if you want. Keep going — you're doing better than you think."

## 8.5 Quarterly Strategy Call (Concierge Only)

**30-minute video call with human coach:**

- Review transformation data
- Identify what's working and what isn't
- Adjust goals, schedule, approach
- Plan for upcoming life events (travel, holidays, busy season)
- Deeper motivation exploration

# Appendix A: Sample Ivy Scripts

## A.1 First Call (Elite)

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name], welcome to Ivy. This is your first call, so let me set expectations.

I'm going to call you [X] times per week — before your workout window to plan, and after to check in. Every time you follow through, your Impact Wallet donates to [Charity].

This isn't about perfection. It's about consistency. And when you're about to skip, text me — we'll find a way to make something count.

So let's start. What's your plan for today?"

## A.2 Morning Planning (Standard)

**Ivy:** "Morning [Name]. Quick check-in: what's your workout plan today?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "[Repeat plan back] at [time]. Got it. I'll check in tonight. And if you're about to skip, text me first. Talk later."

## A.3 Evening Review (Completed)

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name]. [Plan] — did it happen?"

*[User: Yes]*

**Ivy:** "Nice. That's £[X] to [Charity]. How'd it feel?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "[Response]. Same time tomorrow, or different plan?"

## A.4 Evening Review (Missed)

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name]. [Plan] — did it happen?"

*[User: No]*

**Ivy:** "Got it. No judgment. What happened?"

*[User explains]*

**Ivy:** "Makes sense. Here's the question: is there anything small you can do tonight, or is today a true rest day?"

## A.5 Rescue (User-Initiated)

**User:** "I don't want to work out today"

**Ivy:** "I hear you. What's making it hard?"

*[User explains]*

**Ivy:** "That's real. Here's the question: full workout, minimum, or true rest day?

Your minimum is [minimum]. That keeps the streak alive.

What feels doable?"

## A.6 Weekly Planning (Sunday)

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name]. Let's look at the week ahead. I'm seeing [calendar overview]. How do you want to structure your workouts?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "[Repeat plan back]. I'll call [day] morning to lock in the first one. Anything that might get in the way this week?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "Got it. We'll navigate it. Have a good Sunday."

## A.7 Monthly Life Markers

**Ivy:** "Quick monthly check — three questions.

First: any physical changes you've noticed this month?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "Noted. Second: anything you can do now that you couldn't — or wouldn't — a month ago?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "That's a life marker. That's why you're doing this. Third: health confidence overall, 1 to 10?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "Got it. [Reflect on change]. Nice progress. Let's have a good month."

## FAQ

**Is this just an app?**
No. Ivy calls you — actually calls your phone. It's voice-first accountability, not another app to ignore.

**What if I don't answer?**
Elite and Concierge include missed-call recovery. Ivy will text you, then try again. You won't slip through the cracks.

**What's the Impact Wallet?**
Every time you complete a commitment, Ivy donates from your Impact Wallet to your chosen charity. It's baked into your subscription.

**Can I change my schedule?**
Yes. Tell Ivy or update your calendar. She adapts.

**What if I need to pause?**
You can pause anytime. Your streak and data stay intact.

**Is this therapy?**
No. Ivy is accountability, not therapy. If you need mental health support, we'll connect you with resources, not try to replace professional help.
