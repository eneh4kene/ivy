# 1. Overview

## What Is Sponsor Mode?

Ivy Sponsor Mode is a B2B product where companies fund accountability and impact for their employees. Employees get Ivy's voice-based accountability system; the company funds an "Impact Wallet" that donates to charity every time an employee follows through on a commitment.

## Why Companies Buy This

| Pain Point | How Ivy Solves It |
|------------|-------------------|
| Wellbeing programs have low engagement (20% typical) | Ivy is proactive (calls you) not passive (app you ignore) |
| Hard to measure wellbeing ROI | Dashboard shows participation, consistency, and aggregate trends |
| Employees are burning out (especially remote) | Ivy supports routines: fitness, sleep, focus blocks |
| CSR/ESG pressure | Charity donations tied to healthy behaviors = PR-friendly |
| One-size-fits-all doesn't work | Employees choose their own track and goals |

## Core Value Proposition

> "Your company funds your progress. Every time you follow through, they donate to charity on your behalf."

```

## 3.2 The Weekly Rhythm

### Monday Morning — Planning Call

**Ivy:** "Morning [Name]. It's Ivy. [Company] brought me in to help you stay on track — and every time you follow through, they're donating to Mind on your behalf. Quick check-in: what's your workout plan today?"

**User:** "Gym after work, around 6pm."

**Ivy:** "Gym at 6pm. What's the session — weights, cardio, class?"

**User:** "Upper body weights."

**Ivy:** "Upper body at 6pm. I'll check in tonight. And [Name] — if 6pm comes and you're not feeling it, text me. We'll figure out a minimum. Talk later."

*Call length: 45-60 seconds*

### Monday Evening — Review Call

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name], it's Ivy. Gym at 6pm — did it happen?"

**User:** "Yeah, I went."

**Ivy:** "Nice. That's £1 to Mind. How was it?"

**User:** "Good. Felt strong actually."

**Ivy:** "Good days build on each other. Same time tomorrow, or different plan?"

**User:** "Rest day tomorrow. Wednesday I'll run."

**Ivy:** "Wednesday run. Talk Wednesday morning."

*Call length: 30-45 seconds*

### Wednesday Morning — Planning Call

**Ivy:** "Morning [Name]. Wednesday run still the plan?"

**User:** "Yeah, but maybe lunchtime instead of evening."

**Ivy:** "Lunchtime run. I'll text you at 11:30 as a reminder. Talk tonight."

### Wednesday 11:30am — WhatsApp Nudge

```
Ivy: Lunchtime run — still on? Reply 'done' when it's done.
```

### Wednesday 1:15pm — User Reply

```
User: done

Ivy: Logged. £1 to Mind. That's 2 for 2 this week. One more and you 
hit your goal. Talk Friday morning.
```

### Friday Morning — Planning Call

**Ivy:** "Morning [Name]. You're 2 for 2 this week. One more workout and you've hit your goal. What's the plan?"

**User:** "I'm actually really tired. Long week."

**Ivy:** "I hear that. Here's the question: full workout, or minimum viable? What's the smallest thing you'd still feel good about?"

**User:** "Honestly just a 20-minute walk."

**Ivy:** "20-minute walk counts. When?"

**User:** "Lunch."

**Ivy:** "Lunchtime walk. That closes out the week. I'll text at noon. And [Name] — three days of showing up when you're tired is worth more than five days when it's easy. Talk tonight."

### Friday Evening — Completion

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name]. Did the walk happen?"

**User:** "Yeah."

**Ivy:** "That's 3 for 3. Goal hit. £3 to Mind this week — £47 total since you started. Quick check before the weekend: energy this week, 1 to 10?"

**User:** "Like a 6."

**Ivy:** "Got it. Rest up. I'll check in Monday to plan the week. Nice work."

### Sunday Evening — Weekly Planning (Optional)

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name]. Quick look at the week ahead. Any big commitments or travel that'll affect your schedule?"

**User:** "Tuesday I have a dinner thing. Probably can't work out."

**Ivy:** "Got it. So Monday, Wednesday, Friday for workouts?"

**User:** "Yeah."

**Ivy:** "Monday-Wednesday-Friday. I'll call Monday morning to lock in the plan. Have a good Sunday."

## 3.3 The Rescue Flow

**User texts Ivy at 5:45pm:**

```
User: I really don't want to go to the gym today

Ivy: I hear you. Before you decide — what's your minimum? 
The thing you can do even when you don't want to do anything?

User: Maybe just 15 minutes on the bike

Ivy: 15 minutes on the bike. That keeps the streak alive and 
still donates to Mind. Can you do that?

User: Yeah I guess

Ivy: That's the move. 15 minutes. Text me 'done' when it's done.
Not perfect, just something.

[45 minutes later]

User: done. actually did 25 mins

Ivy: See? That's how it works. The hardest part is starting. 
£1 to Mind. Well done.
```

## 3.4 The Miss Flow

**Monday evening — user missed workout:**

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name]. Gym at 6pm — did it happen?"

**User:** "No. Work ran late, I just couldn't."

**Ivy:** "It happens. No judgment. Here's the question: is there anything you can do tonight, even 10 minutes, or is today a true rest day?"

**User:** "I'm exhausted. I just can't."

**Ivy:** "Rest day it is. Tomorrow — what's the plan to get back on track?"

**User:** "I'll run in the morning. 7am before work."

**Ivy:** "7am run. I'll call at 6:45 to make sure you're up. One day doesn't break the streak. Two in a row makes it harder. Talk tomorrow."

# 6. Transformation Tracking

## 6.1 What We Track

| Metric | Frequency | How Captured |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Energy score (1-10) | Weekly | End-of-week call |
| Mood score (1-10) | Weekly | End-of-week call |
| Health confidence (1-10) | Monthly | Monthly check-in |
| Life markers | Monthly | Open-ended question |

## 6.2 Weekly Energy/Mood Check

**Friday evening call (already exists) — add:**

**Ivy:** "Before the weekend — quick pulse. Energy this week, 1 to 10?"

**User:** "6."

**Ivy:** "And mood overall?"

**User:** "7."

**Ivy:** "Got it. Rest up. Talk Monday."

*Adds 15 seconds to call. Captures trend data.*

## 6.3 Monthly Life Markers Check

**First call of each month:**

**Ivy:** "Quick monthly check-in — three questions. First: any physical changes you've noticed? Clothes fitting different, energy levels, anything?"

**User:** "My jeans are looser. And I'm not as tired after lunch."

**Ivy:** "Noted. Second: anything you can do now that you couldn't — or wouldn't — a month ago?"

**User:** "I took the stairs instead of the elevator. Without thinking about it."

**Ivy:** "That's a life marker. Last one: health confidence overall, 1 to 10?"

**User:** "6. Up from like 4 when I started."

**Ivy:** "Real progress. I'm logging all this. Let's have a good month."

## 6.4 How Ivy Uses Transformation Data

**Reflecting progress:**

> "Your energy this week was 7. When you started two months ago, it was 4. That's not the workouts — that's you building a different life."

**During rescue moments:**

> "I know you're tired. But remember what you told me last month? You said you finally had energy after lunch for the first time in years. That came from days like today."

**Monthly summary:**

> "This month: 12 workouts, £24 to charity. But here's what matters — your energy went from 5 to 7. You told me your jeans are looser. That's transformation, not just consistency."

## 6.5 Aggregate Transformation for Employers

# Appendix A: Sample Comms

## A.1 CEO Announcement Email

```
Subject: Introducing Ivy — a new way to build healthy habits (and do good)

Team,

We're launching a pilot program called Ivy.

Here's how it works: Ivy is an AI that calls you a few times a week 
to help you stay on track with whatever matters to you — fitness, 
sleep, focus, whatever.

The twist: every time you follow through on a commitment, the company 
donates to charity on your behalf.

You set your own goals. You choose your charity. You decide when 
Ivy calls.

It's optional. But if you've ever struggled to build a habit on your 
own, this might be worth trying.

[Sign Up Here]

Let's see what we can do together.

[CEO Name]
```

## A.2 HR Follow-Up Email (Day 3)

```
Subject: Ivy — 47 of you have signed up. Here's what's happening.

Hi team,

Quick update on Ivy:

• 47 people have enrolled so far
• First calls started yesterday
• We've already donated £23 to charity through your follow-through

If you haven't signed up and want to, the link is still open: [Link]

If you have questions, reply to this email or ask in #ivy-support.

No pressure. But if you're curious, give it a try.

[HR Name]
```

## A.3 End-of-Season Celebration Email

```
Subject: You did it — £8,574 to charity, powered by your habits

Team,

Season 1 is complete. Here's what you accomplished:

• 126 of you showed up consistently
• 71% of you hit your weekly goals
• You donated £8,574 to charity — just by doing what you said you'd do

Top charities:
• Mind (mental health): £3,684
• WaterAid: £2,406
• Local food bank: £1,784

A few things you told us:
• "I haven't been this consistent in years"
• "The charity part actually motivates me"
• "Ivy is weirdly effective"

Season 2 starts in two weeks. You're automatically enrolled unless 
you opt out.

Thank you for showing up — for yourselves, and for the causes you 
care about.

[CEO/HR Name]

# Appendix B: Sample Ivy Call Scripts

## B.1 First Call Ever

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name], it's Ivy. This is your first call, so let me explain how this works. I'm going to check in with you [X] times a week — morning to plan, evening to see if you did it. Every time you follow through, [Company] donates to [Charity]. That's it. Simple. So — let's start. What's your plan for [track] today?"

## B.2 Morning Planning Call

**Ivy:** "Morning [Name]. Quick check-in: what's your [track] plan today?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "[Repeat plan back]. Got it. I'll check in tonight. And [Name] — if you're about to skip, text me first. Talk later."

## B.3 Evening Review — Completed

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name]. [Plan] — did it happen?"

*[User: Yes]*

**Ivy:** "Nice. That's £[X] to [Charity]. How'd it feel?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "Good. Same time tomorrow, or different plan?"

## B.4 Evening Review — Missed

**Ivy:** "Hey [Name]. [Plan] — did it happen?"

*[User: No]*

**Ivy:** "Got it. No judgment. What happened?"

*[User explains]*

**Ivy:** "Makes sense. Here's the question: is there anything small you can do tonight, or is today a full rest day?"

*[If rest day]* **Ivy:** "Rest day it is. Tomorrow — what's the plan to get back on track?"

*[If minimum]* **Ivy:** "[Minimum]. That counts. Text me 'done' when it's done."

## B.5 Weekly Energy Check

**Ivy:** "Before the weekend — quick pulse. Energy this week, 1 to 10?"

*[User: 6]*

**Ivy:** "And mood overall?"

*[User: 7]*

**Ivy:** "Got it. [Optional: That's up from X when you started.] Rest up. Talk Monday."

## B.6 Monthly Life Markers

**Ivy:** "Quick monthly check — three questions. First: any physical changes you've noticed this month?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "Noted. Second: anything you can do now that you couldn't — or wouldn't — a month ago?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "That's a life marker. Last: health confidence overall, 1 to 10?"

*[User responds]*

**Ivy:** "Got it. Nice progress. Let's have a good month."
